Flight Price Prediction
This project is a web application that predicts flight prices based on user input, using a pre-trained machine learning model. Built with Flask, it allows users to enter flight details such as departure and arrival times, total stops, airline, source, and destination. The application processes these inputs and provides a predicted flight price. The frontend is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for users to get quick price predictions.
